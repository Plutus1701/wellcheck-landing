            <h1>About WellCheck</h1>
            
            <p>I'm a stay-at-home dad with young kids who can't read yet but are definitely interested in phones. I built WellCheck because I had this nagging worry: what if something happened to me while solo parenting and my kids were stuck in the house all day before anyone realized something was wrong?</p>
            
            <p>I searched the App Store but couldn't find what I needed—a simple check-in timer that would alert my wife if I missed it, plus an emergency call screen with big photos my kids could tap to call for help.</p>
            
            <p>Seemed straightforward enough. It wasn't.</p>
            
            <h2>The Reality</h2>
            
            <p>Turns out, iOS restrictions make automated calling and texting really hard. I had to use third-party services (SendGrid for emails, Twilio for SMS) which added recurring costs. My "simple free app" became more complicated and less free than I'd hoped.</p>
            
            <p>But along the way, I realized this isn't just for worried parents. Anyone living alone who wants an extra safety net can benefit—elderly folks, people with medical conditions, solo workers, night shift workers. If there's a chance you could fall, get hurt, or have a medical emergency without easy access to help, this app might give you some peace of mind.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <h3>It Actually Works</h3>
                <p>Both my 3 and 4 year olds learned to make calls with the app after just a couple practice sessions. If it works for them, it can work for anyone.</p>

            <div class="important">
                <h3>Your Privacy Matters</h3>
                <p>All your information stays on your phone. The only data stored externally is phone numbers, which are required for the SMS emergency alerts. That's it. No tracking, no ads, no selling your data to anyone. Ever.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>My Hope</h2>
            
            <p>My hope is that you install WellCheck, set your check-in schedule, and never need the emergency features. Just regular check-ins and quiet peace of mind.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Stay safe.</strong></p>
