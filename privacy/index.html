    <h1>WellCheck Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Simple Summary:</strong> WellCheck stores all your data locally on your iPhone. Nothing is uploaded to servers or shared with third parties. Delete the app = delete your data.
    </div>

    <h2>What Data WellCheck Uses</h2>
    <p>All information is stored only on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> Names, phone numbers, and photos of trusted adults you choose</li>
        <li><strong>Check-In Data:</strong> Your check-in times, alarm schedule, and app settings</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency Alerts:</strong> Record of when alerts were sent</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Where it's stored:</strong> Your iPhone only. Not uploaded anywhere.</p>

    <h2>Permissions Required</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Contacts:</strong> To select trusted adults from your existing contacts</p>
    
    <p><strong>Photos (Optional):</strong> To choose custom photos for contacts</p>
    
    <p><strong>Notifications:</strong> For check-in reminders and emergency alerts</p>
    
    <p><strong>Messages (SMS):</strong> To send emergency alerts to your contacts (requires your approval per iOS requirements)</p>

    <p>You can manage permissions in: <strong>Settings → Privacy → WellCheck</strong></p>

    <h2>Your Data Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>View:</strong> Open WellCheck → Settings</li>
        <li><strong>Delete contacts:</strong> Swipe left on any contact in the app</li>
        <li><strong>Delete everything:</strong> Delete the WellCheck app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p><strong>None.</strong> WellCheck only uses Apple's built-in iOS features. No third-party analytics, tracking, or cloud services.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>WellCheck can be used by children for emergency calling but must be set up by an adult. Since all data stays on your device, no information about children (or anyone) is transmitted or stored externally.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is protected by your iPhone's built-in security. Since nothing is transmitted over the network, there's nothing to intercept.</p>

    <h2>Future Updates</h2>
    <p>If features like iCloud sync are added in future updates, you'll be asked for explicit permission before any data syncing is enabled.</p>
